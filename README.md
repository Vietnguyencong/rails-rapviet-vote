# README

Used to be on https://rapviet.live. 
Now it is only on rapviet.herokuapp.com (we ended our domain contract with domain broker after the contest ended).

This is a project created by Nguyen Le and Viet Nguyen with educational purpose to learn and practice multiple technologies especially Ruby on Rails.

The project was inspired by a very popular Vietnamese rap contest hosted by Vietname National Television Network - Rap Viet. We created this web application to essential allow users to sign up and vote for their favorite rapper. To make the voting more interactive, we also created a chart that displays concurrent voting counts for each rapper. Hence, it allows the voters to see how well their rapper is doing against the competition. 

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails Framework, AWS S3 Storage, Oauth 2.0 with Facebook, Postgresql Database and Heroku Service

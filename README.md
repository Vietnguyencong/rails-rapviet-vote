# README

Used to be on https://rapviet.live. 
Now it is only on https://rapviet.herokuapp.com (we ended our domain contract with domain broker after the contest ended).

This is a project created by Nguyen Le and Viet Nguyen with educational purpose to learn and practice multiple technologies especially Ruby on Rails.

The project was inspired by a very popular Vietnamese rap contest hosted by Vietname National Television Network - Rap Viet. We created this web application to essential allow users to sign up and vote for their favorite rapper. To make the voting more interactive, we also created a chart that displays concurrent voting counts for each rapper. Hence, it allows the voters to see how well their rapper is doing against the competition. 

On our Administrator portal, we provide charts that display concurrent data on the amount of users signed up and voted. Moreover, you will have the ability to perform administrative action such as emailing users, managing rappers, managing users as well as uploading new images.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails Framework, AWS S3 Storage, Oauth 2.0 with Facebook, Postgresql Database and Heroku Service
